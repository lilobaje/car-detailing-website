# Elite Auto Detailing Website 🚗✨

## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to the Elite Auto Detailing website! This project is a meticulously crafted, responsive web application designed to serve as the online presence for a premium auto detailing business. It provides a seamless user experience, showcasing services, a dazzling gallery of work, and easy contact options.

Developed with a focus on modern web standards and clean code, this application demonstrates a strong command of **Flask**, **Jinja2 templating**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** for dynamic client-side interactions. It's built to be intuitive, visually appealing, and fully functional across various devices.

This project isn't just a website; it's a testament to my ability to build professional, maintainable, and user-centric web solutions.
